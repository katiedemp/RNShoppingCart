## Extra Notes
- The cart will need to keep its state during app loads / refreshes
- List Products â€“ these should always be listed to allow adding of products until checkout
- Products should be listed in this format: product name, price, button to add product
- Must be able to add a product to the cart
- Must be able to view number of current products in the cart
- Cart products should be listed in this format: product name, price, quantity, total, remove button
- Product totals should be tallied to give an overall total
- Must be able to remove a product from the cart
- Adding an existing product will only update existing cart product quantity (e.g. adding the same product
twice will NOT create two cart items)
- All prices should be displayed to 2 decimal places
- Use best practices
